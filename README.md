# About
stopPause is a project that turns a clasic emergency stop button into a whackable pause button as a media key.
When the button is pressed a pause action is sent to the computer as a media key. The same media key is sent when button is reset.

Here it is in action...  [And a video can be found here] (https://photos.app.goo.gl/1bEmfZ5BV29aJBT9A)

## How it's made
Using an aurdino ATmega32U4 the stop button is wired to PIN 
(Wireing diagram coming here soon ;) )
